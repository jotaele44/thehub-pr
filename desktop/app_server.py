"""Same-origin ASGI app for the desktop wrapper.

Reuses the repo's existing FastAPI backend and additionally serves the built
Vite frontend from the same port, so the desktop app needs exactly one local
server and no CORS. API routes keep priority because they were registered on
the app before the catch-all below — except for browser page navigations
(Accept: text/html), which the middleware routes to the SPA so that client
routes that share a path with an API endpoint still load on hard refresh.
