# Run THEHUB as a desktop app

Double-click the launcher for your system in the repo root:

| System | File |
|---|---|
| macOS | `PRII-THEHUB.command` |
| Windows | `PRII-THEHUB.bat` |
| Linux | `PRII-THEHUB.sh` |

The **first run** needs an internet connection once: it creates a private
`.venv`, installs the Python dependencies, and builds the dashboard
(requires [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to be installed). Every later run starts
instantly and **works offline** — the app serves the data committed in this
repository from a local server and shows it in a native window.

Offline caveat: map basemap tiles are fetched from the internet
(OpenStreetMap), so without a connection the map background is blank while
all data, tables, and charts keep working.

## How it works

- `desktop/config.py` — the only per-repo file (title, paths, requirements).
- `desktop/app_server.py` — reuses the existing FastAPI backend and also
  serves the built dashboard from the same port (no CORS, one process).
- `desktop/launch.py` — picks a free port, starts uvicorn, opens a native
  [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/) window (falls back to the
  default browser). Flags: `--no-window`, `--browser`, `--smoke`.
- `desktop/setup.py` — idempotent one-time setup (`--force` to redo).

## Command line

```bash
python desktop/setup.py          # one-time setup
.venv/bin/python desktop/launch.py            # native window
.venv/bin/python desktop/launch.py --browser  # browser tab instead
.venv/bin/python desktop/launch.py --no-window  # server only
```

## macOS app icon

`PRII-THEHUB.app` is a double-click macOS app (Apple-silicon and Intel). Double-click
it in Finder and the dashboard opens in its own window — no Terminal. The first
launch runs the one-time setup (needs internet once, plus Node.js for the
dashboard build); after that it starts straight away and works offline.

This repo also ships **`PRII Federation.app`** — the unified launcher. Double-click it to open a window listing all seven federation apps, each with a Launch button (it drives the sibling repos, so keep them cloned next to `thehub-pr`).

Because the app is a small self-locating wrapper around `desktop/launch.py`, it
must stay at the repo root (it finds the repo from its own location). If macOS
blocks the first open, see **If macOS won't open the app** below.
No-Python-required standalone builds are still produced separately by the
`desktop-build` workflow.

## If macOS won't open the app

The apps are safe — both `PRII-THEHUB.app` and `PRII Federation.app` are
open-source launcher scripts you can read in `Contents/MacOS/`. macOS blocks
them only because they aren't signed with a paid Apple Developer ID or notarized
by Apple, so the first open may show *"cannot be opened because Apple cannot
check it for malicious software"* or an *"unidentified developer"* notice. That's
macOS quarantining files downloaded from the internet (it happens especially with
GitHub's **Download ZIP**). Any one of the following clears it — you only do this
once per download:

- **Easiest — run the helper.** Double-click **`Fix-Gatekeeper.command`** in the
  repo root; it clears both apps at once. Then open either app normally. If the
  helper is itself blocked, right-click it → **Open** to run it once.
- **Terminal (always works).** Paste this into Terminal (pasting a command is
  never blocked), then press Return:
  ```bash
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/path/to/thehub-pr/PRII-THEHUB.app" "/path/to/thehub-pr/PRII Federation.app"
  ```
  Tip: type `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ` (with a trailing space) and drag
  each app onto the Terminal window to fill in its path.
- **System Settings.** Double-click the app, let macOS block it, then open
  **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the message naming the app,
  and click **Open Anyway**. On macOS Sequoia 15 and later this replaces the old
  right-click → **Open** trick.
