# Federation Topology — Centinelas → MoneySweep + SpiderWeb → Hub

This document declares how four PRII producers are **grouped and connected** to
carry a single end-to-end flow: pre-officialization intelligence from Centinelas
is turned into *located finance* by the MoneySweep + SpiderWeb pair, and the
result is aggregated and correlated by the Hub.

It complements `registry/producers.yaml` (the machine-readable producer list) and
`ARCHITECTURE.md` (the federated-engines / single-hub doctrine). It does not
change any Hub code — the Hub consumes the result through its existing
aggregate → correlate → ingest pipeline.

- **Intel source — `centinelas-pr`.** Classifies public-interest items into six
  domains and drops JSON payloads into each sibling repo's `intake/` folder.
  `FINANCIAL`/`POLITICAL` route to MoneySweep (the money anchor); every item also
  goes to the Hub.
- **Finance/location fusion pair — `moneysweep-pr` (anchor) + `spiderweb-pr`.**
  MoneySweep ingests the Centinelas drops as *pre-official located-finance
  candidates*, then emits a contract-finance bundle that SpiderWeb scores into a
  municipality-tiered overlay. This pairing is the "assign finances to a location"
  step.
- **Aggregation — `thehub-pr`.** Discovers, validates, aggregates, and correlates
  every producer's canonical export. The located pre-official finance correlates
  across producers by municipality/proximity with no Hub code change.

## Seam contracts

### 1. Centinelas → MoneySweep (intake drop)

- **Producer:** `centinelas-pr` `src/centinelas/route/{router,dispatch}.py`.
- **Transport:** file-drop into `<CENTINELAS_REPOS_DIR>/moneysweep-pr/intake/<item_id>.json`.
- **Contract:** `centinelas-pr/src/centinelas/route/contracts/moneysweep.schema.json`.
  The MoneySweep-bound payload additionally carries pre-officialization
  finance/location enrichment (`municipalities`, `agencies`, `estimated_value`,
  `signal_stage`, `beat`) when the classifier extracted it; MoneySweep re-derives
  municipality from `title`/`body_text` when absent.

### 2. MoneySweep consumes the drop → located finance candidates

- **Consumer:** `moneysweep-pr/moneysweep/runtime/centinelas_intake.py` +
  `scripts/ingest_centinelas_signals.py`
  (hub command `ingest_centinelas`; also `run_all.py --ingest-centinelas`).
- **Behavior:** keeps `FINANCIAL`/`POLITICAL` drops, resolves each to a PR
  municipality with the deterministic `moneysweep.runtime.geo_attribution`, and
  emits export-stream rows (`funding_awards.jsonl`) with a `location` block,
  `source_id="centinelas-pr"`, `signal_stage="pre_official"`, `synthetic=false`,
  and lineage. Registered as source `centinelas_pre_official_signals`.

### 3. MoneySweep → SpiderWeb (contract-finance bundle)

- **Producer:** `moneysweep-pr/scripts/build_contract_finance_bundle.py`
  (hub command `build_contract_finance_bundle`). Reuses
  `scripts/run_contract_finance_geo_reasoning.py` for row-level geo reasoning.
- **Bundle (the handoff):** `outputs/contract_finance_bundle/` (kept separate
  from the geo-reasoner's `outputs/contract_finance/` artifacts so refreshes
  never clobber them)
  - `contract_awards.geojson`, `financial_flows.geojson`
    (`properties`: `record_id`, `entity_id`, `amount`, `date`,
    `municipality_code`, `municipality_name`, `feature_type`, `source_layer`,
    `source_id`),
  - `municipality_funding_density.csv` (one clean row per municipality),
  - `contract_finance_ingest_report.json` (producer, `export_contract_version`,
    and a `centinelas_pre_official` provenance block).

### 4. SpiderWeb scores the bundle (assign finances to a location)

- **Consumer:** `spiderweb-pr/readiness/contract_finance_layer.py`
  (`build_contract_finance_layer`) via `scripts/build_contract_finance_layer.py --input <bundle>`.
- **Output:** `contract_finance_scored_overlay.geojson` (per-feature
  `spiderweb_score` + `evidence_tier`) and `contract_finance_layer_report.json`,
  which surfaces the Centinelas pre-official contribution
  (`centinelas_pre_official.feature_count` / `located_feature_count`, plus the
  producer-reported block).

### 5. → Hub (aggregate → correlate → ingest)

- MoneySweep's `funding_awards`/`transactions` (including Centinelas-derived
  pre-official candidates) and their recipient/funding-agency **entities** (which
  carry the `location` block), plus SpiderWeb's observations/overlay, reach the
  Hub through their canonical federation packages.
- `src/hub/correlate.py` `derive_relationships` correlates:
  - **entities** by normalized name, external id, and lat/lon proximity
    (`correlate_spatial`, on entity `location`), and
  - **funding awards / transactions** by date + shared primary entity
    (`correlate_temporal`).

  So the located pre-official finance correlates with officialized money and
  spatial records **through its anchoring entity's location** (spatial) and by
  temporal proximity — not by a direct `funding_award.location` join. This needs
  **no Hub code change**: MoneySweep already emits the recipient/agency as an
  entity carrying the `location` block. (`correlate.py`'s `_municipality` helper is
  used for alert/observation footprint links, not the finance path.)

## Provenance & guardrails

- Centinelas-derived rows are **pre-official**, not officialized money:
  `signal_stage="pre_official"`, `synthetic=false`, `source_id="centinelas-pr"`,
  full lineage. Downstream consumers can filter or weight them accordingly.
- Location attribution is enrichment, never a filter: unresolved rows are kept
  with an empty `municipality_code`. Within the MoneySweep intermediate/bundle
  the geo-attribution vocabulary is used (`exact_fips`/`exact_name`/`unknown`),
  but the canonical Hub `location.attribution_confidence` is a **number in
  `[0, 1]`** (`schemas/federation_funding_award.schema.json` /
  `federation_transaction.schema.json`). The canonical export maps the vocabulary
  to a numeric confidence (or omits the field) so `hub validate-package` accepts
  the pre-official rows — never emit the string `"unknown"` on a canonical row.
